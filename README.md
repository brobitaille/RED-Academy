#Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Git, GitHUB

Attempt 1:

I was initially doing OK with the code out of this page until I attempted the stretch goals. In the process of adding Flexbox to my CSS, I messed up the formatting to the point I considered the original "bricked". 

**LESSON LEARNED**
The importance of VERSION CONTROL!

Attempt 2:

Went well. Tried to keep CSS document more organized than the first attempt and limit the amount of unnecessary/repetitive code.

I am hoping that my web page looks OK on different resolution screens.

##Personal Learnings

I learned a lot while coding out the RED webpage. It was an enlightening experience. This assessment has stressed the importance of applying what I learn to a project of my own. I found that actively seeking solutions to problems when it came to the design layout enhanced the learning process. Trail and error, breaking code and attempting to fix it was rewarding and educational.

###Changes Upon Revisit

Need to work on Flexbox so that I'm not as reliant on box method properties for layout.
Was unable to increase the height of hr element
Would like to have been able to vertically center the logo and nav (did my best manually).
